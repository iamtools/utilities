Some utilities for CA Identity Manager.


1. emptylog:
   This one can be used to purge a huge ADS log. 
   
2. CAIMAllTextareaResizable.user.js
   This Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script can adjust all textarea fields on CA Identity Manager User Console to be resizable. 
   Specially it's for BLTH java script developers to enlarge the javascript textarea fields during script development.
